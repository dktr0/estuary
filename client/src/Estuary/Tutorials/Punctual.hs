You can copy any of the code examples in this tutorial to the editor at the bottom of the page, make sure that Punctual is selected in the drop-down menu, and click Evaluate, to see/hear what they do. You can also click directly on any code examples to copy and evaluate (\"make it go\") automatically. Changing things in the examples is highly recommended! This first set of examples will draw a white circle in various locations. Click on the various examples to try them out (there will be a small delay before each example takes effect):")

The second number after the word circle is the bottom-to-top position of the centre of the circle, with the bottom of the screen being -1, the middle being 0, and the top being 1. The third number after the word circle is how big the circle is (its radius). We can also use Punctual to make sound:")

You can make it quieter by decreasing the -20db to lower values such as -30db or -40db. We can also use Punctual to make sound and visuals at the same time, using similar language. In the example below note how one line ends with => rgb and is drawing a circle on the screen, while the other line ends with => splay and is causing some sound to happen. Notice also that the two lines have a semicolon (;) between them. You can even put the two statements on the same line but you must have a semicolon (;) between them. When you are finished playing with these examples, you can click Next (above) to go to the next page of this tutorial.")
