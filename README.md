Estuary is a platform for collaboration and learning through live coding. It enables you to create sound, music, and visuals in a web browser. Key features include:

- built-in tutorials and reference materials
- a growing collection of different interfaces and live coding languages
- support for networked ensembles (whether in the same room or distributed around the world)
- text localization to an expanding set of natural languages
- visual customization via themes (described by CSS)

The development of Estuary is the result of ongoing collaborative work that has been supported by two grants from Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) - initially for the project "Projectional interfaces for musical live coding", and more recently as part of the project "Platforms and practices for networked, language-neutral live coding". Estuary builds upon, and depends on, the work of many others, including but not limited to all those who contribute to Reflex, TidalCycles, and other languages and projects. Estuary is free and open source software, released under the terms of the GNU Public License (version 3).

You don't need to install or build anything to start using Estuary - you can just point your web browser to an existing deployment of it, and start making things! At the time of writing, a stable, recent version of Estuary is online 24/7 at a test server belonging to the research group at McMaster University that is working on Estuary - you can try it out anytime at the following URL: https://estuary.mcmaster.ca. For discussion, help, and assistance, head over to the following Discord server (make an account on discord.com first): https://discord.gg/snvFzkPtFr

(Note that building Estuary depends on a rather complex tool-chain and can be time-consuming - building Estuary from source yourself is not recommended.)
